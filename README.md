# Responsive Images

This project consists of two parts. 
 - An index.js file, that uses selenium, libvips, etc. to do all the processing
 - A src folder, that contains your html and master images.

## Getting Started
Install dependencies with `npm install`. This demo was written with node v6.9.4, on osx, and requires Google chrome.

Once installed just run `npm start`.
This will process the `/src` folder and put the output in a `/gen` folder
